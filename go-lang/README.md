# Go lang version
----

i found that this program in python is slow and take so many memory when using sqlite3
then i found another language to make the program again
here comes Go lang version with faster speed and less memory consumption

to compile the controller, install go first, then run 
```ternimal
go get -d ./...
go build ./controller.go
```
in terminal under the `go-lang` folder.

for the usage details of controller, use `./controller` to check.
